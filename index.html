					<p>The Rankin Spence Group Inc. is an accounting and bookkeeping firm with over 30 years of experience delivering full-cycle 
					accounting and bookkeeping excellence to small and medium-sized enterprises. </br></br>
					We have a variety of clients from small partnerships to businesses that run a multi-shift operation. We work with organizations 
					in the private and not-for-profit sector – from car dealerships, light manufacturers and travel agencies to construction companies 
					and union halls. Each client teaches us something about the business of accounting and we bring that collective knowledge and 
					experience to our work with every client.</br></br>
					But we aren’t just skilled technicians and experienced veterans. We also know that to keep the financial side of your business 
					humming, the three dimensions of the accounting eco-system need to be working well together:</br>
					People 	• 	Processes 	• 	Professionals</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-pane fade" id="people">
					<p>At Rankin Spence, we have plenty of experience working in organizations large and small. We know the roles and personalities that contribute to the accounting function. We work day-to-day with our clients and their employees to answer questions, solve problems and get things right. We can even help you hire the right people for the job. And when extra support is needed, we are skilled and certified trainers and trouble-shooters. We can help make sure that everything from year-end to a new system implementation are handled with a minimum of stress and disruption for your accounting team. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-pane fade" id="processes">
					<p>The right systems and processes are not only vital to deliver accurate accounting, they are also essential if you want to extract meaningful business information from your efforts. At Rankin Spence, we are certified consultants for QuickBooks Pro and Sage Accounting (formerly Simply Accounting) software. [FreshBooks cloud accounting?] We can help you select, install, configure and maintain your accounting software. We can train your people. And, we can address systems issues when they arise, usually without having to engage software specialists at an extra cost to you. We also maintain professional associations with the Association of Independent Accounting Professionals (AIAP), the Institute of Professional Bookkeepers of Canada (IPBC), and the Canadian Payroll Association (CPA) to ensure we are putting current industry knowledge and professional standards to work for you every day.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-pane fade" id="professionals">
					<p>We work closely with a number of Chartered Accountants and CA firms. In fact, many of our clients are referred to us by our CA colleagues because they appreciate the quality of our work. How does that deliver value to you? Everything we do, from the configuration of your system and the coaching of your people to the maintenance of your files and preparation of your statements is executed with the goal of providing your CA with a clean set of books at the end of the business cycle. If we work all year to get things right, then year-end has fewer surprises; your accountant is able to do his or her job easily – and you save money, time and stress.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-8">
				<p>Laurie has been working since she was 15 years old, finishing high school and university while fully immersed in the often contradictory worlds of manufacturing and retail. Her first full-time job was working in an injection-molding factory where, at the age of 17, she was responsible for running the weekend shift while attending school full-time. That’s also where Laurie migrated into the office and developed a passion for the accounting function. With a business degree from the University of Toronto under her belt, Laurie began exploring the world of finance from a variety of perspectives, eventually working as a Controller for a Fortune 500 company and even doing a stint as a personal financial advisor. Motivated by the challenge of improving processes and people, Laurie began sharing her direct, matter-of-fact style and accounting acumen with multiple business clients in 1991 under the name Rankin Management Services. In 2014, she expanded her ability to serve more clients by inviting other professionals to join her in establishing the Rankin-Spence Group. In her spare time, Laurie can be found wandering the world, seeking new places to enjoy a good book, a great meal and a fine handbag.</p>
